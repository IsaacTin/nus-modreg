Authentication API:

1. Authenticate user and get JWT (POST) - /api/auth

Sends the NUSNET ID and password to the database to verify, and obtain JWT for the user

req: NUSNET ID and password
res: JWT for user
err: 400 if credentials are invalid

2. Get the logged in user from the JWT (GET) - /api/auth

Uses the auth middleware to obtain the user from the JWT. If successful, auth will return the user from the JWT.

req: user obtained from JWT
res: user obtained from JWT without the password
err: 401 if no token or wrong token
